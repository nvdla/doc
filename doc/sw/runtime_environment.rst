The runtime envionment includes software to run a compiled neural network on compatible :term:`NVDLA` hardware. It consists of 2 parts:

* :ref:`user_mode_driver` - This is the main interface to the application. As detailed in the :ref:`compiler_library`, after parsing and compiling the neural network layer by layer, the compiled output is stored in a file format called :term:`NVDLA Loadable`. User mode runtime driver loads this loadable and submits inference jobs to the :ref:`kernel_mode_driver`.

* :ref:`kernel_mode_driver` - Consists of kernel mode driver and engine scheduler that does the work of scheduling the compiled network on :term:`NVDLA` and programming the :term:`NVDLA` registers to configure each functional block.

The runtime environment uses the stored representation of the network saved as :term:`NVDLA Loadable` image. From point of view of the :term:`NVDLA Loadable`, each compiled "layer" in software is loadable on a functional block in the :term:`NVDLA` implementation. Each layer includes information about its dependencies on other layers, the buffers that it uses for inputs and outputs in memory, and the specific configuration of each functional block used for its execution. Layers are linked together through a dependency graph, which the engine scheduler uses for scheduling layers. The format of an :term:`NVDLA Loadable` is standardized across compiler implementations and UMD implementations. All implementations that comply with the :term:`NVDLA` standard should be able to at least interpret any :term:`NVDLA Loadable` image, even if the implementation may not have some features that are required to run inferencing using that loadable image.

Both the :ref:`user_mode_driver` stack and the :ref:`kernel_mode_driver` stack exist as defined APIs, and are expected to be wrapped with a system portability layer. Maintaining core implementations within a portability layer is expected to require relatively few changes. This expedites any effort that may be necessary to run the :term:`NVDLA` software-stack on multiple platforms. With the appropriate portability layers in place, the same core implementations should compile as readily on both Linux and FreeRTOS. Similarly, on “headed” implementations that have a microcontroller closely coupled to :term:`NVDLA`, the existence of the portability layer makes it possible to run the same kernel mode driver on that microcontroller as would have run on the main CPU in a “headless” implementation that had no such companion microcontroller.

.. figure:: images/umd.png

    :align: center

UMD provides standard :ref:`umd_api` (API) for processing loadable images, binding input and output tensors to memory locations, and submitting inference jobs to KMD. This layer loads the network into memory in a defined set of data structures, and passes it to the KMD in an implementation-defined fashion. On Linux, for instance, this could be an ``ioctl()``, passing data from the user-mode driver to the kernel-mode driver; on a single-process system in which the KMD runs in the same environment as the UMD, this could be a simple function call. Low-level functions are implemented in :ref:`user_mode_driver`

Kernel Mode Driver
------------------

.. figure:: images/kmd.png
    :scale: 70%
    :align: center

The KMD main entry point receives an inference job in memory, selects from multiple available jobs for execution (if on a multi-process system), and submits it to the core engine scheduler. This core engine scheduler is responsible for handling interrupts from :term:`NVDLA`, scheduling layers on each individual functional block, and updating any dependencies based upon the completion of the layer. The scheduler uses information from the dependency graph to determine when subsequent layers are ready to be scheduled; this allows the compiler to decide scheduling of layers in an optimized way, and avoids performance differences from different implementations of the KMD.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Core Engine Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Neural networks are converted to hardware layers for execution on DLA hardware. These layers are connected to each other using dependency graph and executed on DLA by module known as engine scheduler. This scheduler is responsible for updating dependency counts, handling events and programming hardware layers. It is the core module of DLA software and portable across different OS. Portability layer should use below interfaces to enable core engine module. Core engine module is also referenced as firmware as same source code would be used in firmware of companion controller for headed configs.
